  TASK 1
    - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
    - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

/* 
  TASK 4
  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
  1. The first principle is window binding. When "this" is in the global scope it will return the window object. If none of the other rules apply "this" will default to the window. The window object is an error and we do not want this.
  2. The next principle is implicit binding. In this principle "this" refers to the object to the left of the dot when a function is called.
  3. The third principle of "this" is new binding. "this" refers to the newly created object that the constructor function creates. When we call the function we have to use the "new" keyword.
  4. The last principle is explicit binding. "this" is explicitly bound when we use .call or .apply to bind an object.
